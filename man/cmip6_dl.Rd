\usage{
cmip6_dl(
  outdir = getwd(),
  aoi = NULL,
  models = NULL,
  scenarios = NULL,
  elements = NULL,
  years = NULL,
  latest = TRUE,
  workers = 10,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{outdir}{The directory to which to write the downloaded data. Defaults
to the current working directory.}

\item{aoi}{Optional. An \code{\link{sf}} object specifying an area of interest.
If omitted, data for the entire globe are downloaded.}

\item{models}{Optional. A character vector of models to download. If
omitted, all models are downloaded.}

\item{scenarios}{Optional. A character vector of scenarios (shared
socioeconomic pathways) to download. If omitted, all scenarios are
downloaded.}

\item{elements}{Optional. A character vector of elements (meteorological
variables) to download. If omitted, all elements are downloaded.}

\item{years}{Optional. An integer vector of years to download. If omitted,
all years are downloaded. Data area available from 1950--2100.}

\item{latest}{Whether to remove legacy versions of the data where
new ones exist. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{workers}{Parallelization is supported by default with 10 workers.
Specify an integer value of more or fewer workers if desired. Note that
specifying too many workers may cause download requests to be rejected
by the NASA NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 host servers.}

\item{force}{Whether to re-download data that already exists on disk.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble:tbl_df-class]{tibble::tbl_df}} listing the downloaded data.
}
\description{
Data are downloaded either from the NCCS THREDDS Data Catalog (using the
NetCDF Subset Service) or the official NASA NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 AWS archive. This
function chooses which service to download from based on whether the user
specifies an area of interest (\code{aoi}).
}
\details{
Specify an \code{aoi} as an \code{\link{sf}} object to crop data to a
specific bounding box. Downloaded data are \emph{not} masked to the \code{sf} object,
merely constrained to its bounding box.
